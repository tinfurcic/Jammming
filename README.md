# Jammming React App

The app's core functionality is adding playlists to user's Spotify account. The user can search for tracks from the Spotify's catalogue, add them to and remove them from a separate list of tracks, and when they're ready, they can save it as a Spotify playlist to their account.

Making this web app was the goal of one of practice projects given in Codecademy's Front-End Developer Path. 

## Features
- Automatic user authentication.
- Every change made in the search bar renders a new list of results. 
- Search results are tracks, but searching for artists or albums will often return those artists' tracks or tracks from that album.
- Upon saving the playlist, the user is notified whether saving was successfully completed, or if an error occurred.
